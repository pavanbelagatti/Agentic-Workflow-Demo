# Agentic-Workflow-Demo

Agentic workflows are the future of AI-powered automation â€” and in this video, weâ€™ll show you how to build one from scratch!

Watch as we convert an unstructured PDF into an intelligent, queryable knowledge system using:

ðŸ”¹ Unstructured â€“ to extract rich text from complex documents

ðŸ”¹ LangChain + OpenAI â€“ to build an intelligent RetrievalQA agent

ðŸ”¹ SingleStore â€“ to store raw and vectorized content in one place

Youâ€™ll learn how to combine document parsing, vector storage, and LLM-based retrieval into a seamless agentic pipeline.

Whether you're building document copilots, internal chatbots, or AI tools for knowledge discovery â€” this guide will get you up and running fast.
